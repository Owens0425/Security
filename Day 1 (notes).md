      - Backdoor Detection
      - Vulnerability Expoitation
  - Nmap scripts stored in /usr/share/nmap/scripts
      - Syntax: nmap --script=filename
  # Vulnerability and Exploitation Research
  - Transitioning from Scanning and Reconnaissance to implementing/attackng or securing system based on what is found
